41407,2012-01-30,"A woman from Burma was held in immigration detention for 11 months at 6 different facilities before she was released on an Order of Supervision on November 14, 2012. 

<b>Unnecessary and lengthy detention</b>

Orders of supervision are usually granted when a person is ordered deported but the government cannot remove them -- often because the person's country of origin cannot or will not provide travel documents, or because the individual would face persecution. About  <a href=""http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=907#6"">30% of refugees to the U.S. in 2011 came from Burma</a> ... yet it took the U.S. government 11 months to realize it could not send this woman back."
114485,2012-12-05,"A woman from Mexico was held at 3 different detention facilities over two months before she was deported on Dcecember 7, 2012.

Two days before her deportation, she was one of at least a dozen detainees who ICE suddenly evacuated from Jefferson County Justice Center in southern Illinois afterwards all but one of its medical personnel resigned.

Immigrants described Jefferson as ""house of maladies."" In November of 2012 the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) filed a lawsuit against ICE and Jefferson County on behalf of seven immigrants who also were part of the evacuation who claimed the facilities were unsanitary and lacked proper health conditions. NIJC documented reports of MRSA, tuberculosis, respiratory infections, and skin funguses among people held at Jefferson County before the evacuation. The lawsuit challenges numerous constitutional violations. According to  federal law, ICE cannot detain people in facilities that have failed two consecutive inspections, yet Jefferson failed inspections four years in a row from 2006 to 2009.

Detainees reported that requests for medical treatment were ignored, the showers and restrooms were rotting with mold, drinking water was brown and putrid, jail cells were poorly ventilated, and the uniforms provided were tattered and soiled. NIJC Director Mary Meg McCarthy says the Jefferson situation is not isolated and that similar egregious conditions are found in ICE facilities across the country.

ICE's contract with Jefferson County shows the county made hundreds of thousands of dollars to detain and transport immigrants."
19436,2012-11-23,"A man from Jamaica was detained for 9 months in 6 different facilities before he was deported on November 29, 2013.

<b>Last Stop</b>
Many detainees from the Midwest spend a few days at Jena/LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana before they leave the country. Jena is an isolated prison about a 3-hour drive from Baton Rouge. Operated by the private prison corporation GEO Group, the facility holds more than 800 people. Massive privately owned prisons dominate the immigration detention landscape in the southern U.S. and are known for egregious human rights violations. People deported from Illinois in November and December 2012 also had brief stays at similar prisions in Texas and New Mexico."

<b>Impact on Illinois</b>

A report from the <a href=""http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/UserFiles/File/Task%20Force%20Reports/Heartland%20Paper%20-%20Mexican%20Immigration%2009.pdf"">Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a> revealed that of the more than 130,000 Mexicans who immigrated to Illinois between 2001 and 2005, 51% were undocumented. Current U.S. immigration law provides few opportunities for Mexican immigrants to legally migrate to the United States.

This impact on Illinois is economic and personal. As the Chicago Council on Global Affairs reports, ""While the Midwestern economy has created large numbers of jobs for lowskilled workers, a primary source of workers for those jobs—persons from Mexico—have little access to legal employment."" The toll on families is incalculable. Nationwide, more than <a href=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/12/us_deports_more_than_200k_parents.html"">205,000 parents of U.S. citizens</a> were deported between July 2010 and September 2012.

34512,2013-03-29,"A woman from Chile was detained for 9 months in 7 different facilities. During her time in custody, she was transferred more than 30 times. Many of these transfers were between McHenry County and the Chicago Immigration Court, but she also was held for various stretches at 5 different county jails.

<b>Costly and Dangerous Transportation</b>

The U.S. government pays hundreds of thousands of dollars to counties and private companies to transport men and women between detention facilities and court hearings. Detainees report that immigration officials often refuse to stop for bathroom breaks--even during trips as long as 8 hours--and they are told to urinate in a shared bottle. <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/blog/prisoners-rights-immigrants-rights/immigration-detainees-fear-rape-and-death"">Studies</a> have found that female immigrants are particularly vulnerable to assault during transport.

149487,11/13/2012,"An girl from Honudras was held at a Chicago-area childrens facility for two months. Each year DHS apprehends thousands of immigrant children, placing many of them in deportation proceedings. Among these children are asylum seekers, youth who entered the U.S. unlawfully to reunite with family members, and others who entered legally and overstayed their visas. A 1985 legal settlement known as <i>Flores v. Reno</i> sets guidelines for the detention, release, and treatment of children in immigration custody. The Chicago area is home to about five juvenile facilities where the government holds unaccompanied children until the government is able to identify a guardian to whom they can be safely released for the duration of their immigration proceedings."
20756,2012-08-10,"A woman from Poland was transported 16 times between 5 facilities over a period of 6 months before she was deported on November 28, 2012.

<b>Lost in the System</b>

Families and lawyers of immigrants in detention often struggle to keep track of where their loved ones are held. In 2010, ICE established an <a href=""https://locator.ice.gov/odls/searchByName.do"">Online Detainee Locator System</a> and protocols to notify lawyers when people are moved to new facilities. Even with these systems in place, it can still take a few days to find a person who is suddenly moved."
