Illinois in the ICE Age
=======================

Built during [Chicago MigraHack](http://www.chicagomigrahack.com/) in June 2013

Based on [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtcgndtySy1xdDBtQXUwMXRVV081b0lVQUd0ZTlQY0E#gid=0) compiled by the [Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse](http://trac.syr.edu/)


Enhancements
------------

It would be great to add these features that we didn't get to during the hackathon:

* Ability to follow individuals as they move through the system
* Popups with details about each facility
* Ability for people to call in and share their family's stories using Vojo or the Twilio API
